# Conversor.c

This was a exercise for the discipline of File Organization and Processing. The program reads an "input.txt" file containing two columns. The first column of the input file specifies the numeral system, while the second specifies the number that must be converted. After reading the file, the program converts the numbers to other numeral systems (binary, decimal and hexadecimal) and writes the result in an "output.txt" file. The program and the input file must be on the same folder/directory.

# Conversor.java and FileIO.java

This program does the same of the one forementioned. The FileIO class reads the "input.txt" file and writes to the "output.txt" file. It calls the Conversor class to process the conversions, which in turn returns a List with the converted numbers. To run the program, execute FileIO.java through the terminal or your prefered IDE. The classes and the input file must be on the same folder/directory.

# input.txt

This is an example to be used with the Conversor programs.
